1. Volatility factors:
  * **Total Volatility (VOL)**: 
  It measures the total volatility of the instrument. With higher volatility, it demands for higher return.
  * **Upper/Down Volatility (UVOL/DVOL)**: 
  It measures the volatility by trend (go up or down) of the instrument. With higher unilateral volatility, the price volatility is higher in this side.
  * **Relative Volatility (RSJ)**: *𝐑𝐒𝐉 = 𝐔𝐕𝐎𝐋 − 𝐃𝐕𝐎𝐋* 
  It measures the relative volatility of the instrument. With higher absolute value of relative volatility, it shows short-term pressure (sharp long and steady short power), and lower future return.
